# Comparisons of various R package outputs of GLS, LME, GEE functions based on simulations

In this project, we compare the outputs of R packages that implement GLS,
LME, and GEE based on simulated scenarios. We investigate the performance of these methods and their R
implementations to recover the true coefficients and error
terms, and examine the heterogeneity captured in the different
models.The goal is to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of
these methods and inform the selection of appropriate
methods for practical applications.
