# Comparisons of various R package outputs of GLS, LME, GEE functions based on simulations

In this project, we compare the outputs of R packages that implement generalized least squares (GLS) ,
linear mixed-effect models (LME), and generalized estimating equation (GEE) based on simulated scenarios. 
We discuss the differences of these methods, investigate the estimating performance of these methods, and their R
implementations to recover the true coefficients and error
terms. Finally, we examine the heterogeneity captured in the different
models. The goal is to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of
these methods and inform the selection of appropriate
methods for practical applications.
